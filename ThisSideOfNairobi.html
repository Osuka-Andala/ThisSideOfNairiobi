<div id="About" class="row">

<p>Nairobi is situated at 1°17′S 36°49′E in South-Central Kenya, 140 Kilometers ( 87  miles) south of the Equator.<br>
It is surrounded by 113 km² ( 70 mi²) of plains, cliffs and forest that makes up the city’s Nairobi National Park. It is adjacent to the eastern edge of the Rift Valley, and to the west of the city, are The Ngong Hills. Mount Kenya is situated north of Nairobi, and Mount Kilimanjaro is towards the south-east.<br>

It is the most populous city in East Africa, with a current estimated population of about 3.5 million. This makes it the 14th largest city in Africa.<br> I got this information from the Nairobi County Government website. It is an accurate description, but its not my description. I want to share with you the definition on Nairobi from this side of things. From a nairobian's point of view.<br> The  idea of Nairobi from an onlookers point of view and from the Kenyans that have never been to the city's point of view.<br> I do not own a camera. The beautiful images of Nairobi are mostly by the amazing Mutua Matheka and Click.<br>Welcome.</p>
